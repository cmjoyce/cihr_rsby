# CIHR RSBY linking code and analyses

To create the women dataset, start with DLHS linking code to get structure. Then follow with NFHS linking code to create combined DLHS 3, DLHS 4, NFHS 4, and NFHS 5 dataset. Finally, combine with AHS file. 

Pregnancy dataset code is embedded in DLHS and NFHS files. Follow same order as for women.

Each survey uses a different ID for districts. The district harmonization codes are contained in their own folder. Once the harmonized files are created they are used in each survey's cleaning file.
